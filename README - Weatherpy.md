# python-api-challenge
Using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
**WeatherPy Overview**

WeatherPy is a Python project aimed at visualizing weather patterns across over 500 cities situated at varying distances from the equator. It utilizes the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data and employs problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather conditions worldwide.
Requirements
Part 1: WeatherPy

    Objective: Develop a Python script to visualize weather data of over 500 cities.
    Tools: Utilize citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills.

Requirements Details

    Create Plots: Visualize relationships between weather variables and latitude.
    Compute Linear Regression: Analyze linear regression for each relationship, segregating data into Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Instructions

    Clone the repository and open WeatherPy.ipynb.
    Retrieve weather data using the provided code.
    Create scatter plots illustrating the specified relationships.
    Compute linear regression for each relationship and generate corresponding plots.
